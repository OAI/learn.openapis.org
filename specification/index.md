# The OpenAPI Specification Explained

The [OpenAPI Specification](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.0) is the ultimate source of knowledge regarding this API description format. However, its length is daunting to newcomers and makes it hard for experienced users to find specific bits of information. This chapter provides a soft landing for readers not yet familiar with OpenAPI and is organized by topic, simplifying browsing.

The following pages introduce the syntax and structure of an OpenAPI document, its main building blocks and a minimal API document. Afterwards, the different blocks are detailed, starting from the most common and progressing towards advanced ones.

- [Structure of an OpenAPI Document](structure): JSON, YAML, `openapi` and `info`
- [API Endpoints](paths): `paths` and `responses`.
- [Content of Message Bodies](content): `content` and `schema`.
- [Parameters and Payload of an Operation](parameters): `parameters` and `requestBody`.
- [Reusing Descriptions](components): `components` and `$ref`.
- [Providing Documentation and Examples](docs): `example` and `examples`.
- [API Servers](servers): `servers`.
